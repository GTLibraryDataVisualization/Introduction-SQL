This workshop is designed to be paired with "SQL Deep Dive" developed by Pulak Agarwal.

Out of scope: advanced queries, stored procedures; creating databases; accessing SQL through other methods (python, php ...), relational algebra / relational calculus

Files:
info.docx : basic information on SQL - open this first
create_db.sql : contains code to create database
sql_workshop.sql : 
sql_shell.sql : contains only comments to guide code; this will be used the file where we code live in the workshop

Flow of workshop:
1.	Discuss mySQL, relational data
2.	Introduce basic queries and describe SQL structure
3.	Get to more advanced query logic by coming up with situations where there are more constraints or requirements on each query
