### WORKSHOP ###

### QUICK EXPLORATION ###
/** use statement
this will allow us to use the database we want to work with, since you can have multiple DBs loaded into mysql
	-> you can also just click on it in the mysql left sidebar under "Schemas"
**/
use HR;

/** basic select statement and limit statement
helpful if you have a huge dataset and just want a sample
**/
select * from employees
limit 10;

/** select where
allows you to put a constraint on which data you're getting
**/
select * from employees
where salary > 10000;

/** order by
allows you to sort data
**/
select * from employees
order by salary desc;

/** sum / avg
**/
select sum(salary) as "Total Salary", avg(salary) as "Average Salary"
from employees;

/** max / min
**/
select max(salary) as "Highest Salary"
from employees;


### MORE INVOLVED QUERIES ###

/** nested query
sometimes the data you need requires more than one step to get
for example if we want to find the maximum salary, but also show the rest of the info with that row
**/
select first_name, last_name, salary
from employees
where salary = (select max(salary) from employees);

/** count / group by
count and group by allow us to see how many of a certain piece of data we have
you can also use "having" to constrain a function

here we use it to find the number of employees with each job_id, where the number of employees exceeds 1
**/
select job_id, count(*) as "Num Employees"
from employees
group by job_id
having count(*) > 1
order by count(*) desc;

/** distinct
allows you to count the distinct number of something in a table
**/
select count(job_id)
from employees;

select count(distinct job_id) as "Num Jobs"
from employees;

/** basic join
this uses foreign keys, which is a "link" from one table to another
in this case, the job_id column from the jobs table matches the job_id column from the employees table
therefore, we can use a join to get information from both tables

for a simple (2-table) join, the first table you talk about is referred to as the "left" table ...
... and the 2nd table you are joining is the "right" table

this join is also known as an "inner join" - see venn diagrams
note: you can give the tables nicknames - here we use "e" for employees and "j" for jobs. you can also do this with other joins
**/
select employees.first_name, employees.last_name, jobs.job_title
from employees
join jobs on employees.job_id = jobs.job_id;

/** natural join
this is a type of inner join which finds the matching foreign keys for you
effectively the same as the join above, but you do not need to include the "on" clause
**/
select employees.first_name, employees.last_name, jobs.job_title
from employees
natural join jobs;

/** selecting from two tables at once as join / naming shortcuts
this is a method of implicitly joining tables where it we select from two different tables and join PKs on a "where"
**/
select e.first_name, e.last_name, j.job_title
from employees e, jobs j
where e.job_id = j.job_id;

/** joining three tables
sometimes you will find you need to join more than two tables
you can theoretically link an infinite number of tables as long as you handle the foreign keys correctly
in this example we take each city, its corresponding country, and region name through using two join statements
**/
select locations.city, locations.country_id, regions.region_name
from locations
join countries on countries.country_id = locations.country_id
join regions on countries.region_id = regions.region_id;

/** outer join example
the difference between this join and the other is that this will also display employees that have no dependents.
in short, an outer join displays every rows from one table along with matching rows from the other table
**/
select e.first_name, e.last_name, d.first_name, d.last_name
from employees e
left join dependents d
on e.employee_id = d.employee_id;


### CHALLENGES ###
# example solutions are at the very end so you don't cheat
# writing something makes your brain work hard so please do try this 


							### CHALLENGE 1 ###
# using what you have learned, write a query to get the following data:
#	the first name, last name, and job title of all employees
#	along with the first and last name of any dependents they have
#	do NOT display employees that don't have dependents



							### CHALLENGE 2 ###
# write your own query including the following and describe its usefulness
#	at least one where statement
# 	a join statement OR nested query
#	an order by statement


							### CHALLENGE 3 ###
# write your own query including the following and describe its usefulness
#	an aggregating function (sum, max, avg, ...) alongside a group by statement
#	at least one join statement
#	an "as" statement to rename returned column



/** order of operations
this query is to demonstrate the order in which you're supposed to perform statements in sql
this is copied from https://sqlbolt.com/lesson/select_queries_order_of_execution

I wasn't clever enough to come up with a query containing every single one of these
I'm not sure one is possible. if you can generate one then you are better at SQL than the instructor

anyway, this block will error if you run it
**/
-- SELECT DISTINCT column, AGG_FUNC(column_or_expression), â€¦
-- FROM mytable
--     JOIN another_table
--       ON mytable.column = another_table.column
--     WHERE constraint_expression
--     GROUP BY column
--     HAVING constraint_expression
--     ORDER BY column ASC/DESC
--     LIMIT count OFFSET COUNT; -- we didn't talk about offset. it will skip a given number of rows in the return



### EXAMPLE SOLUTION ###

-- CHALLENGE 1
# select e.first_name, e.last_name, j.job_title, d.first_name, d.last_name
# from employees e
# join jobs j on e.job_id = j.job_id
# join dependents d on e.employee_id = d.employee_id



-- CHALLENGE 2
	-- this returns every city with its corresponding state/province, country name, and region name
    -- this helps because we are able to see full information for each location
    -- it is also returned shown in a way that is readable, i.e. we see names instead of ID numbers
# select l.city, l.state_province, c.country_name, r.region_name
# from locations l
# join countries c on l.country_id = c.country_id
# join regions r on c.region_id = r.region_id
# order by city asc;



-- CHALLENGE 3
	-- this returns the average salary for employees that have a child vs those that do not
	-- this could help a data analyst determine whether there is a significant difference in salary between the groups
# select avg(e.salary) as "avg salary", d.relationship
# from employees e
# left join dependents d on e.employee_id = d.employee_id
# group by d.relationship;
